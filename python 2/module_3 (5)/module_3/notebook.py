    The Minister wants a planting recommendation by Friday morning, and the answer is sitting in a database nobody can question fast enough. This week you turn four raw survey tables into a single **Pandas** DataFrame and interrogate it: which crop thrives in the highlands, which soils are most productive, and exactly which fields meet every condition for a strong harvest. Loading and joining SQL tables, cleaning the messy real-world entries, then grouping, filtering, sorting, and querying your way to an answer — the core data-analysis loop, on real data, delivered against a deadline. The closing piece of your Maji Ndogo engagement, and the one the Minister will actually read.

    ### Instructions

    - Do not add or remove cells in this notebook. Do not edit or remove the `### START FUNCTION` or `### END FUNCTION` comments. Do not add any code outside of the functions you are required to edit. Doing any of this will result in a mark of 0%.

    - Use the provided test cells to verify your output before submitting.
    - Do not hard-code answers.
    - The use of StackOverflow, Google, and other online resources is permitted. The use of Generative AI tools — including ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, and others — is also allowed and encouraged as a learning partner. However, the code you submit must reflect your own understanding. Copying a fellow student's code is a breach of the honor code. [Read the honor code here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1atFOPUQRLz5slb4Q1ASXh8QQfKyXVqrw/preview). Submitting code you do not understand is also a breach.

    Sanaa's phone rings on Thursday afternoon.

    "The Minister needs a crop recommendation for the northern highland plots by Friday morning," the assistant says. "Specifically: which crop performs best up there, what soil types are most productive, and which fields should be prioritized for the next planting cycle."

    Sanaa puts the phone down and looks at you. "We have the data. We have the Field Registry. What we do not have is a fast way to ask it questions."

    That changes today. The tools you need are already installed: **Pandas** turns the farm survey database into a structured DataFrame that you can filter, group, sort, and transform with single lines of code. The analysis that takes an afternoon with raw Python takes twenty minutes with Pandas.

    The Ministry is waiting.

    ## Challenge 1: Crop distribution

    Before recommending where to plant, we need to understand where crops currently grow and what conditions they share. For a given crop type, the average rainfall and average elevation immediately tells us whether it is a highland or lowland species.

    ### Task

    Complete `explore_crop_distribution(df, crop_filter)`. It must filter the DataFrame to rows where `Crop_type` matches `crop_filter`, then return a **tuple** of `(mean Rainfall, mean Elevation)` as plain Python floats.

    > ⚠️ Do not change the function name `explore_crop_distribution`.

    ### Expected output

    **Input 1:** `explore_crop_distribution(MD_agric_df, 'tea')` → `(1534.5079956188388, 775.208667535597)`

    ## Challenge 3: Climate and geography by crop

    For every crop type, we need the average elevation, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and rainfall.

    ## Challenge 4: Top-performing crop

    Time to identify Maji Ndogo's single best-performing crop — the one with the most fields exceeding the average `Standard_yield`.

    **Hint:** After grouping, the labels of the grouping column can be accessed with `.index`. For example:
    ```python
    grouped_df = MD_agric_df.groupby('Soil_type').mean(numeric_only=True).sort_values('Elevation', ascending=False)
    print(grouped_df.index[0])

    ### Task

    Complete `find_ideal_fields(df)`. It must:
    1. Filter to fields with an above-average `Standard_yield`.
    2. Group by `Crop_type` and count records per group.
    3. Sort to put the highest count first.
    4. Return the `Crop_type` name at index 0 as a **string**.

    ## Challenge 5: Ideal growing conditions

    Given a crop type, return only the fields that meet all four quality criteria simultaneously. This is a natural fit for the `.query()` method, which reads almost like the sentence above — though a boolean mask works just as well.

    Complete `find_good_conditions(df, crop_type)`. Filter to rows where:
    1. `Crop_type` matches `crop_type`.
    2. `Standard_yield` is above that crop's own mean `Standard_yield`.

    ## Wrapping up

    Five functions. Together they answer the questions the Ministry put on the table:

    1. What conditions define each crop? → `explore_crop_distribution` and `climate_geography_influence`
    2. Which soil types are most productive? → `analyse_soil_fertility`
    3. Which crop performs best and under what precise conditions? → `find_ideal_fields` and `find_good_conditions`

    The recommendation writes itself: **tea**, in the cool, clean, high-elevation plots of the northern highlands. And the work behind it — joining four tables, cleaning the data, then grouping, filtering, sorting, and querying — is the everyday loop of a working data analyst. Across this course you went from raw algorithms to objects to a real Pandas analysis delivered on a deadline, proof you can take a question from a decision-maker and return an answer they can act on.

    Make sure all cells run without errors before submitting. The Ministry meeting is at eight.
