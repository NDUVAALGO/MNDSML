    Notebooks are great for exploration, but production systems need something more resilient. When an audit deadline forces three consultants to work across drifting copies of the same analysis, messy copy-pasted code quickly becomes a maintenance nightmare. In this project you will refactor raw analytical code into a production-quality data pipeline for Maji Ndogo. You will work with modular Python scripts for SQL ingestion, run purpose-built data-processing classes, configure a single-source-of-truth parameter dictionary, and deploy automated two-sample Welch's t-tests to validate field measurements against weather station readings. This is the software-engineering transition that turns exploration scripts into reliable, reusable systems.

    "I tried to run the analysis on the updated database and got an error on line 47. The column rename code is in three different notebooks, each slightly different. One of them has the old database filename. I fixed it in one place and it broke in another."

    She adds: "We are not building a notebook. We are building a system. Notebooks are for exploration. Systems are for production. We need to separate the two."

    This is the wall every data scientist hits eventually. Notebook code works, but it does not *scale*. When the same thirty lines of setup code appear in every notebook, slightly different each time, maintenance becomes a full-time job. The auditor's deadline made it worse — three people editing three notebooks in parallel, each drifting in a different direction.

    The solution is **modular Python scripts**. One module for data ingestion. One for field data processing. One for weather data processing. Every notebook imports these modules in two lines. When something changes, you fix the module once and every notebook inherits the fix.

    By the end of this project you will have a production-quality data pipeline: documented, testable, and reusable.

    ## Challenge 1: Document the data ingestion module

    `data_ingestion.py` contains three functions that form the foundation of the pipeline: `create_db_engine` connects to the SQLite database, `query_data` runs a SQL query and returns a DataFrame, and `read_from_web_CSV` fetches a CSV from a URL. Each function is already implemented and includes error handling.

    Good documentation is not optional in a production pipeline — it is what makes a script reusable by teammates, reviewable by auditors, and maintainable six months from now.

    ### Task

    1. Open `data_ingestion.py`.
    2. Add a **module-level docstring** at the very top of the file (before any imports) describing what the module does in one to three sentences.
    3. Add a **PEP 257 compliant function docstring** to each of the three functions. Each docstring must include:
       - A one-line summary of what the function does.
       - A `Parameters` section listing every argument with its type and description.
       - A `Returns` section describing the return value and its type.
       - A `Raises` section listing any exceptions the function may raise.
    4. Run the verification cell below.

    > ⚠️ Do not change the function logic — only add documentation.

    ## Challenge 2: Configure the pipeline

    A production pipeline has one single source of truth for its parameters. Rather than hunting through the code every time the database path changes or a new crop spelling correction is discovered, every parameter lives in a single configuration dictionary. Change one value, and the whole pipeline picks it up.

    The two weather-data URLs are already provided in the template below.

    Complete the `config_params` dictionary. Every key is provided — fill in the four missing values using the parameters that have been consistent across all three notebooks in this course.

    - `sql_query`: the four-table LEFT JOIN query used since Week 1.
    - `db_path`: the SQLite connection string used since Week 1.

    ## Challenge 5: Data validation with hypothesis testing

    The pipeline is running and both DataFrames are loaded. Now we close the loop on the audit question: do the field measurements and weather station readings agree?

    In Week 2 we used one-sample t-tests to compare field means against fixed reference values. Here we use **independent-samples t-tests** (`ttest_ind`) because we now have actual measurement samples from both sources — we are comparing two distributions, not one distribution against a constant.

    Note that the field DataFrame uses the column name `Ave_temps` for temperature, while the weather DataFrame labels it `Temperature`. Your `filter_field_data` function must map between these names.

    ### Task

    Complete the four functions below. Each must include a docstring and must not be hard-coded.

    - `filter_field_data(df, station_id, measurement)` — return the corresponding column from the field DataFrame as a Series for rows where `Weather_station == station_id`, dropping NaN values. Use an internal mapping to handle the `Temperature` → `Ave_temps` name difference.
    - `filter_weather_data(df, station_id, measurement)` — return the `Value` column as a Series for rows where `Weather_station_ID == station_id` and `Measurement == measurement`, dropping NaN values.
    - `run_ttest(column_a, column_b)` — return `(t_stat, p_val)` from `ttest_ind` with `equal_var=False` and `alternative='two-sided'`.
    - `print_ttest_results(station_id, measurement, p_val, alpha)` — print one clearly formatted result line per test. If `p_val > alpha`, indicate that H₀ is not rejected; otherwise indicate that H₀ is rejected.

    > ⚠️ Do not change the function names.

    ### Expected output

    ```
    No significant difference in Temperature at Station 0 (P-value: 0.90761 > 0.05). H₀ not rejected.
    No significant difference in Rainfall at Station 0 (P-value: 0.21621 > 0.05). H₀ not rejected.
    No significant difference in Pollution_level at Station 0 (P-value: 0.56418 > 0.05). H₀ not rejected.
    No significant difference in Temperature at Station 1 (P-value: 0.47241 > 0.05). H₀ not rejected.
    ...

    | **Collect** | Ingested farm survey data from a SQL database and IoT weather CSVs |
    | **Clean** | Corrected swapped columns, fixed spelling errors, merged mapping data |
    | **Explore** | Profiled distributions and relationships — rainfall by province, crop volumes and yields, correlation analysis (Week 1) | |
    | **Analyze** | Applied population metrics, the CLT, confidence intervals, and t-tests (Week 2) |
    | **Productionize** | Refactored exploration code into modular, documented, testable scripts (Week 3) |

    ### Task

    Answer the two questions in the markdown cell below.

    1. The Week 2 one-sample t-tests found significant rainfall discrepancies at 4 of 5 stations when comparing field means against fixed reference values. The Week 3 independent-samples t-tests found **no** significant differences at any station. Explain in 3 to 5 sentences why these two tests can give different conclusions on the same data.

    2. You are presenting this pipeline to a new client in Spain who wants to validate their own agricultural survey data against government weather station records. Name two things you would need to change in `config_params` and one thing you would need to verify about `field_data_processor.py` before running it on their data.

    **Your response:**

    1. The one-sample t-test compares a sample mean against a single fixed reference value. If the published station average is slightly off — due to rounding, a different time window, or a different averaging method — the test treats that discrepancy as real, leading to rejection. The independent-samples (Welch's) t-test compares the full distributions of both the field and weather data, accounting for the natural variability in each. Because both samples are drawn from the same underlying conditions, their distributions overlap heavily, and the test correctly finds no significant difference. In short, the one-sample test was comparing against a potentially imprecise constant, while the two-sample test compared the actual data, which agreed.

    2. Two things to change in `config_params`: (a) `db_path` and `sql_query` would need to point to the Spanish client's database and tables, and (b) `values_to_rename` would need to reflect any spelling errors or category inconsistencies specific to Spain's crop types. One thing to verify in `field_data_processor.py`: the column names assumed in `rename_columns` and `apply_corrections` (e.g., `Crop_type`, `Elevation`) must match the Spanish database schema — if their columns are named differently, the processor would need to be updated.

    ## Wrap up

    The pipeline is built, documented, and validated. Loading and cleaning the entire Maji Ndogo dataset — which used to mean 30 lines of setup code copied across every notebook, slightly different each time — now takes two lines and a config dictionary.

    The audit has a clear, evidence-based answer. The workflow is packaged. The next consultant who picks this up — whether in Maji Ndogo, Spain, or elsewhere — can run it in minutes.

    Before submitting:
    - Challenge 1 must print the three correct module names.
    - Challenge 2 config must run without errors.
    - Challenges 3 and 4 must produce the correct shapes.
    - All graded functions in Challenge 5 must include docstrings.
    - All cells must run without errors from top to bottom.
